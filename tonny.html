          Tony Robbins, byname of Anthony Robbins, original name Anthony J.
          Mahavorick, (born February 29, 1960, Glendora, California, U.S.),
          American motivational speaker and “life coach” who created a
          multifaceted business empire by preaching a gospel of
          self-improvement. Robbins was born Anthony J. Mahavorick to a
          working-class family. In childhood he adopted the surname of a
          stepfather. During his youth he discovered that he had a talent for
          public speaking, and he began to read the works of such inspirational
          writers as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Dale Carnegie. Robbins did not go
          to college but instead took a job organizing seminars for the
          motivational speaker Jim Rohn. He also trained with John Grinder, a
          linguist and codeveloper of “modeling,” a technique through which a
          trainee attains success by closely copying the conscious and
          unconscious behaviour of a successful person. In the early 1980s
          Robbins began to hold his own seminars, which came to be described as
          secular revival meetings.
